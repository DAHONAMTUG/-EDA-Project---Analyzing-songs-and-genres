  EDA Project -  Analyzing songs and genres
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in the data analysis process that involves summarizing and visualizing data to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

In the context of songs and genres, EDA could involve the following steps:

Load the data: Load the songs and genres data into a Python data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame.

Clean the data: Handle any missing or incorrect data and make sure the data is in a format suitable for analysis.

Summarize the data: Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for the numerical columns in the data.

Visualize the data: Use plotting libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to help understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

Identify patterns and relationships: Use the summary statistics and visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between the songs and genres.
